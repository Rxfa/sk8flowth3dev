I realized I had been on freecodecamp working the IT Cert. 
finished python then started the Responsive Web Design path.
7/28 before I decided to hang up for the night

Today was random but I'm excited to try to do this.

Woke up excited. Posted my tweet to my Facebook group ( accountability right!!!?)

Todays goal was to work with some python in addition to continuing my Responsive Web design section.
The hour i spent today was for a project targeted at fuzzing sites and doing something with the data. I set up a simple folder with some things to find to test it out.
I had an idea awhlie ago to start using python the way others do, for really useful things. I spent today working on my version of a website fuzzer.
Day2.py is the project i will keep improving upon and using what i learn to make it better. Python for Pentesters concepts gave me a few ideas.
