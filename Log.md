# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 14, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I realized I had been on freecodecamp working the IT Cert. 
finished python then started the Responsive Web Design path.
7/28 before I decided to hang up for the night

 

**Thoughts:** Today was random but I'm excited to try to do this.

**Link to work:** [Python Fuzzing tool](https://github.com/a1c43my/sk8flowthed3v)

### R1D1:

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [insert project ](https://github.com/a1c43my/sk8flowthed3v)


### R1D2:

**Today's Progress**:
Todays goal was to work with some python in addition to continuing my Responsive Web design section.
The hour i spent today was for a project targeted at fuzzing sites and doing something with the data. I set up a simple folder with some things to find to test it out.
I had an idea awhlie ago to start using python the way others do, for really useful things. I spent today working on my version of a website fuzzer.
Day2.py is the project i will keep improving upon and using what i learn to make it better. Python for Pentesters concepts gave me a few ideas.

**Thoughts**: Woke up excited. Posted my tweet to my Facebook group ( accountability right!!!?)

### R1D3:

**Today's Progress**: Successfully worked out some kinks in my python project
**Today's Progress part 2**: Responsive Web Design Cert - CSS (23/44)



### R1D4:

**Today's Progress**:
I finished the CSS part of the Responsive Web Design path. Definitly learned alot. My python is coming along. I studied some threading then spent my day working it into the port scanner. ended up moving just a few things around and WOW. I am beyond excited to be making progress little by little.


### R1D5:

**Today's Progress**: today was busy !!! work caught me sliping but i did manage to work on some C++ and python basics just to keep up. no web design today.




### R1D6:

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the web design Cert. about halfway through the second CSS portion. I worked on some C++ today, threading and pointers. i also have an idea for a project, ticket system. lining it up to start in my other repo, themadhatter.

### R1D21

**Today's Progress**: not so goof at keeping up. Some updates: fuzzing script is under reveiw for some more use possibly. Worked in some practice with threading, started back working with some sockets to see if i can make something cool. Currently working to bridge the gap on what language is best for the task ( in general python vs c++). all for now, but wow, its only been a few weeks and i already have more projects with use cases. i started looking at docker to make some website projects that i can play with.
